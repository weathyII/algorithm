Exactly — your understanding is spot on, and your explanation is super clear! Let's walk through it carefully and cleanly, using your terms:

### Formalized Steps:

1. **Divide by connected components.**  
   - We can treat each connected component independently and then **multiply** the answers for each component together.
   
2. **For a single component:**  
   - We need the graph to be **bipartite** (otherwise no "good painting" is possible, i.e., answer is `0`).
   - In a bipartite graph:
     - Vertices split into two disjoint sets (say, Part A and Part B) such that all edges go between Part A and Part B.

3. **Good Paintings Counting:**
   - In one part (say, A), we can assign only odd numbers `{1, 3}` → 2 choices per vertex.
   - In the other part (say, B), we can assign only even number `{2}` → 1 choice per vertex.
   
   BUT, **which part is odd and which is even can be chosen freely**, so:
   
   - **Option 1:** Part A odd (2 choices per vertex), Part B even (1 choice per vertex).
   - **Option 2:** Part A even (1 choice per vertex), Part B odd (2 choices per vertex).
   
4. **Therefore, total ways for a component:**  
   
   \[
   2^{a} \times 1^{b} + 1^{a} \times 2^{b} = 2^a + 2^b
   \]
   
   where:
   - \(a = \) size of Part A
   - \(b = \) size of Part B

5. **Final Answer:**  
   - Multiply the number of ways over all components.
   - Modulo `998244353`.
